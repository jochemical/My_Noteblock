# My Notes

This elegant React web application allows users to create, edit, and delete their personal notes. The interface is intuitive and user-friendly. Users can add a new note using the "+" icon and
complete or discard it with the "Done" or "Back" buttons. Empty notes are automatically removed. The
overview displays all notes along with the time of the last modification, a title, and a preview of
the content.
